During today's session covering developing judgment about appropriate STL container usage and performance tuning strategies for various data processing scenarios, we focused on understanding container selection criteria, analyzing scenarios, discussing trade-offs and misuse, and solving hypothetical problems.

Your strengths:

You demonstrated a strong understanding of time complexity and its direct impact on container selection, particularly distinguishing between ordered and unordered containers.
You effectively identified appropriate containers for specific scenarios, such as using unordered_map for fast lookups and deque for efficient operations at both ends.
You showed excellent problem-solving skills by proposing a hybrid solution (map + vector) to address complex requirements for both ordered storage and fast lookups.
Areas for improvement:

While you correctly identified the limitations of vector for certain operations, revisiting the foundational readings on STL container properties, especially comparisons between vector, list, and deque for various insertion/deletion patterns, could further deepen your understanding.
